<objective>
Migrate `.paul/paul.json` → `.paul/paul.toml` for pre-v1.4 projects, or create `.paul/paul.toml` from STATE.md for projects that have a `.paul/` directory but no manifest at all.

**When to use:**
- Projects initialized before v1.4 that still have paul.json (auto-migration also happens on any workflow contact)
- Projects with `.paul/` but no manifest file (paul.json or paul.toml)
- After upgrading PAUL framework to v1.4+ to explicitly migrate existing projects
</objective>
