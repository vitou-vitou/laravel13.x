<purpose>
Handle phase-level transition after all plans in a phase are complete. Evolves PROJECT.md, verifies phase completion, cleans up, and routes to next phase or milestone completion.

**Invoked by:** unify-phase.md when it detects "last plan in phase"
**Scope:** Phase N → Phase N+1 (or milestone completion)
</purpose>

<when_to_use>
- All plans in current phase have SUMMARY.md files
- Phase is ready to close
- Moving to next phase or completing milestone
</when_to_use>

<step name="verify_phase_completion" priority="first">
1. Count PLAN.md files in current phase directory
2. Count SUMMARY.md files in current phase directory
3. **Verification:**
   - If counts match: Phase complete
   - If counts don't match: Phase incomplete

**If incomplete:**
```
════════════════════════════════════════
PHASE INCOMPLETE
════════════════════════════════════════

Phase {N} has incomplete plans:
- {phase}-01-SUMMARY.md ✓
- {phase}-02-SUMMARY.md ✗ Missing
- {phase}-03-SUMMARY.md ✗ Missing

Options:
[1] Continue current phase (execute remaining plans)
[2] Mark complete anyway (skip remaining plans)
[3] Review what's left
════════════════════════════════════════
```

Wait for user decision before proceeding.

**If complete:** Continue to next step.
</step>

<step name="cleanup_handoffs">
1. Check for stale handoffs in phase directory:
   ```bash
   ls .paul/phases/{current-phase}/HANDOFF*.md 2>/dev/null
   ```
2. If found, delete them — phase is complete, handoffs are stale
3. Note: Active handoffs at `.paul/` root are preserved
</step>

<step name="evolve_project">
**Read phase summaries:**
```bash
cat .paul/phases/{current-phase}/*-SUMMARY.md
```

**Assess and update PROJECT.md:**

0. **Frontmatter:** If PROJECT.md has YAML frontmatter, update `description` if the project's core value statement has evolved during this phase. Preserve `type` and `about` fields unchanged.

1. **Requirements validated?**
   - Any requirements shipped in this phase?
   - Move to Validated section: `- ✓ [Requirement] — Phase X`

2. **Requirements invalidated?**
   - Any requirements discovered unnecessary or wrong?
   - Move to Out of Scope: `- [Requirement] — [reason]`

3. **Requirements emerged?**
   - New requirements discovered during building?
   - Add to Active: `- [ ] [New requirement]`

4. **Key Decisions to log?**
   - Extract decisions from SUMMARY.md files
   - Add to Key Decisions table

5. **Core value still accurate?**
   - If product meaningfully changed, update description
   - Keep it current

**Update footer:**
```markdown
---
*Last updated: [date] after Phase [X]*
```
</step>

<step name="review_accumulated_context">
Update STATE.md Accumulated Context section:

**Decisions:**
- Note 3-5 recent decisions from this phase
- Full log lives in PROJECT.md

**Blockers/Concerns:**
- Resolved blockers: Remove from list
- Unresolved: Keep with "Phase X" prefix
- New concerns from summaries: Add

**Deferred Issues:**
- Update count if issues were logged
- Note if many accumulated
</step>

<step name="update_state_for_transition">
Update STATE.md Current Position:

```markdown
## Current Position

Phase: [N+1] of [total] ([Next phase name])
Plan: Not started
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: [today] — Phase [N] complete, transitioned to Phase [N+1]

Progress: [updated bar based on completed plans]
```

Update Session Continuity:
```markdown
## Session Continuity

Last session: [today]
Stopped at: Phase [N] complete, ready to plan Phase [N+1]
Next action: /paul:plan for Phase [N+1]
Resume file: .paul/ROADMAP.md
```
</step>

<step name="update_roadmap_completion">
Update ROADMAP.md:

1. Mark current phase complete:
   - Status: ✅ Complete
   - Completed: [date]
   - Plan count: X/X

2. Update progress summary:
   - Phases: Y of Z complete
   - Calculate percentage
</step>

<step name="sync_paul_toml">
**Sync project manifest and ledger:**

Reference: @src/references/toml-sync.md

**1. Sync paul.toml** (Pattern 1):
   - Check for `.paul/paul.toml` first
   - If not found: check for `.paul/paul.json` → auto-migrate per Pattern 3
   - If neither found: skip silently
   - Update fields:
     - `phase.number` → next phase number
     - `phase.name` → next phase name
     - `phase.status` → "not_started"
     - `phase.plans_completed` → 0
     - `stats.total_phases` → increment by 1
     - `paul.version` → current PAUL framework version
     - `stats.last_activity` → current ISO timestamp

**2. Append to ledger.toml** (Pattern 2):
   ```toml
   [[entry]]
   action = "transition"
   phase = [completed phase number]
   at = "[ISO timestamp]"
   ```
</step>

<step name="commit_phase">
**Git commit for completed phase:**

**1. Check for feature branches from this phase:**
```bash
git branch --list "feature/{phase}*"
```

**2. If feature branch exists:**
```
────────────────────────────────────────
Feature branch detected: feature/{phase-name}

Checking for conflicts with main...
────────────────────────────────────────
```

Check for conflicts:
```bash
git fetch origin main 2>/dev/null || true
git diff main...feature/{phase-name} --stat
```

**If no conflicts:**
```
No conflicts detected.

Merge feature/{phase-name} to main? [yes/no]
```

If yes:
```bash
git checkout main
git merge feature/{phase-name} --no-ff -m "Merge feature/{phase-name} into main"
git branch -d feature/{phase-name}
```

**If conflicts exist:**
```
⚠️ Conflicts detected between feature/{phase-name} and main.

Cannot auto-merge. Options:
[1] Resolve conflicts manually, then re-run transition
[2] Keep on feature branch (do not merge)
[3] Force merge anyway (not recommended)
```

**3. Stage phase files:**
```bash
git add .paul/phases/{phase}/ .paul/STATE.md .paul/PROJECT.md .paul/ROADMAP.md
git add src/  # If source files were modified
```

**4. Create phase commit:**
```bash
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
feat({phase}): {phase-description}

Phase {N} complete:
- {plan-01 summary}
- {plan-02 summary}
- {plan-03 summary}

Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>
EOF
)"
```

**5. Record git state for complete-milestone:**
Update STATE.md Accumulated Context:
```markdown
### Git State
Last commit: {short-hash}
Branch: main
Feature branches merged: {list or "none"}
```

Display:
```
Git commit created: {short-hash}
  feat({phase}): {phase-description}
```
</step>

<step name="verify_state_consistency" priority="critical">
**CRITICAL: Verify state files are aligned before declaring transition complete.**

State consistency is foundational to PAUL. If STATE.md, PROJECT.md, or ROADMAP.md are misaligned, all downstream work breaks — resume fails, progress tracking is wrong, context is lost.

**1. Re-read all three files completely:**
```bash
cat .paul/STATE.md
cat .paul/PROJECT.md
cat .paul/ROADMAP.md
```

**2. Verify alignment across these fields:**

| Field | STATE.md | PROJECT.md | ROADMAP.md |
|-------|----------|------------|------------|
| Version | `Version:` field | Current State table | Version Overview |
| Phase | `Phase:` field | (implicit in Active) | Phase Structure table |
| Status | `Status:` field | `Status:` in table | Phase status column |
| Focus | `Current focus:` header | (matches Active) | Current Milestone |

**3. Check for stale references:**
- No "blocked on X" if X is complete
- No "IN PROGRESS" for completed phases
- Current focus matches current phase, not previous
- Progress bars match actual plan counts

**4. If ANY misalignment found:**
```
════════════════════════════════════════
⚠️ STATE CONSISTENCY ERROR
════════════════════════════════════════

Misalignment detected:
| Field | STATE.md | PROJECT.md | ROADMAP.md |
|-------|----------|------------|------------|
| {field} | {value} | {value} | {value} |

Fix ALL misalignments before proceeding.
This is a blocking error — do not route to next phase.
════════════════════════════════════════
```

**Fix the issues, then re-verify.**

**5. If aligned:**
```
State consistency: ✓
  STATE.md    — Phase {N+1}, v{version}, ready to plan
  PROJECT.md  — v{version}, {active_count} active requirements
  ROADMAP.md  — Phase {N} ✅, Phase {N+1} 🔵
```

**Only proceed to route_next after verification passes.**
</step>

<step name="route_next">
**Check if milestone complete:**

1. Read ROADMAP.md
2. Find all phases in current milestone
3. If current phase is LAST in milestone → Route B (milestone complete)
4. If more phases remain → Route A (next phase)

---

**Route A: More phases remain**

```
════════════════════════════════════════
PHASE {N} COMPLETE
════════════════════════════════════════

✓ All {X} plans complete
✓ PROJECT.md evolved
✓ Ready for next phase

---
Next: Phase {N+1} — {Name}

[1] Yes, plan Phase {N+1} | [2] Pause here
════════════════════════════════════════
```

**Accept:** "1", "yes", "continue" → run `/paul:plan` for Phase N+1

---

**Route B: Milestone complete**

```
════════════════════════════════════════
MILESTONE COMPLETE
════════════════════════════════════════

🎉 {version} is 100% complete — all {N} phases finished!

✓ All phases unified
✓ PROJECT.md evolved
✓ Ready for next milestone or release

What's next?

[1] Start next milestone | [2] Review accomplishments | [3] Pause here
════════════════════════════════════════
