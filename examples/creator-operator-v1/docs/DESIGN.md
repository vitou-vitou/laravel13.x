# Creator Operator — UX / UI map

**App:** `examples/creator-operator-v1` · **URL:** http://creator-operator-v1.test  
**Aligned with:** [Creator Commission spec](../../../docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-13-creator-commission-tiktok-first-design.md) · [Pilot kit](../../../docs/creator-commission/README.md) · [Weekly batch checklist](../../../docs/creator-commission/weekly-batch-checklist.md)

This is **not** a consumer storefront (see `marketplace-v2/docs/DESIGN.md`). Creator Operator is an **ops console**: batch workflow, approval queue, publish log, settlement — the Google Sheet tabs rendered as role-aware UI.

## Personas & jobs

| Persona | Job | Primary screens | Doc anchor |
|---------|-----|-----------------|----------|
| **Operator** | Run weekly batch per creator; package metadata; publish after approval | Dashboard, creator hub, publish log forms | `weekly-batch-checklist.md` steps 1–6 |
| **Creator** | Approve or skip packaged videos in 24–48h; trust transparency | Approval inbox | Spec § Asset Workflow step 5; Lite tier = approve all |

**Trust UX (Segment A):** show TikTok source link, proposed title, operator notes; never imply operator owns the channel. Copy uses **approve / skip**, not “buy” or “checkout”.

## Operational page flow (source of truth)

Maps spec § Weekly batch loop + checklist sections:

  S1[1 BUILD LIST] --> S2[2 ELIGIBILITY]

  S3 --> S4[4 PACKAGING]
  S4 --> S5[5 APPROVAL]

| Step | Checklist | Portal today | CSV / tab |
|------|-----------|--------------|-----------|
| 1 BUILD LIST | New TikTok URLs since `last_run_date` | Operator dashboard + creator `last_run_date` | — (Slice 3: CLI import) |
| 2 ELIGIBILITY | Music policy, on-brand, not duplicate | Edit row → status `skipped_*` | `publish-log.status` |
| 3 ASSET | Clean file received | Creator onboarding notes + packaging `notes` | Onboarding tab (Sheet) |
| 4 PACKAGING | YT title, IG caption in notes | **Add publish row** form | `title_variant`, `notes` |
| 5 APPROVAL | Creator 24–48h | **Creator approvals** inbox | `pending_approval` → `approved` |
| 6 PUBLISH + LOG | Live URLs + IDs | **Mark published** on edit | `yt_url`, `ig_url`, `posted_time` |
| 7 REPORT | Weekly light + monthly settlement | **Built** — metrics + settlement tabs + creator reports | `weekly-metrics`, `monthly-settlement` tabs |

## Publish log status (state machine)

Matches [README status table](../../../docs/creator-commission/README.md#publish-log-status-values):

```
pending_approval ──approve──► approved ──mark published──► published
       │                           │
       └── skip (creator) ──► skipped_creator
       └── skip (music)   ──► skipped_music  (operator, step 2)
       └── failure        ──► error
```

| Status | UI badge | Who sets | Next action |
|--------|----------|----------|-------------|
| `pending_approval` | Amber | Operator (step 4) | Creator approves |
| `approved` | Sky | Creator or operator | Operator publishes |
| `published` | Emerald | Operator (step 6) | Metrics (slice 1) |
| `skipped_music` | Stone | Operator | None |
| `skipped_creator` | Stone | Creator (Skip button) | None |
| `error` | Red | Operator | Fix + republish |

```

**Nav labels (doc-aligned):** Operator → **Batch queue** · **Creators** · **Billing** · **Integrations** · Creator → **Approvals** · **Reports** · **Settlement**

**Creator hub subnav (`x-creator-hub-nav`):** Publish log · Weekly metrics · Settlement · TikTok import

## Design tokens (ops console)

Borrow admin patterns from [Flowbite application blocks](https://flowbite.com/blocks/application/) — dense tables, status pills, no marketing hero.

| Token | Value | Use |
|-------|--------|-----|
| Page bg | `stone-50` | Operator/creator shells |
| Panel | `white` + `shadow-sm` + `rounded-lg` | Tables, forms |
| Primary action | `gray-900` / `indigo-600` links | Operator CTAs |
| Success publish | `emerald-50` border panel | Mark published block |
| Dev banner | `amber-50` | Login prefill only |
| Font | Instrument Sans (Breeze default) | — |

**Status colors:** same as `x-publish-status` (amber / sky / emerald / stone / red).

## Next slices — UX map

### Slice 1 — Weekly metrics

**Doc:** `templates/weekly-metrics.csv` · checklist § REPORT (weekly light)

| Route | Screen |
|-------|--------|
| `/operator/creators/{id}/metrics` | Weekly rows: `week_start`, `videos_published`, `best_video_*`, `experiment`, `experiment_result`, `operator_notes` |
| `/operator/creators/{id}/metrics/create` | Post-batch summary form (operator fills after step 6) |
| `/creator/reports` (optional) | Read-only weekly snapshot email preview |

**UX:** One row per batch week; link `best_video_url` to publish log row; show experiment as callout card on creator hub.

**Acceptance:** Operator can record week 1 pilot metrics without opening Google Sheets.

---

### Slice 2 — Monthly settlement

**Doc:** `templates/monthly-settlement.csv` · spec § Attribution formula

| Route | Screen |
|-------|--------|
| `/operator/creators/{id}/settlement` | Table: period, platform, payout, **S**, **T**, attributed revenue, commission %, ops fee, creator net |
| `/operator/creators/{id}/settlement/create` | Form with live formula preview: `attributed = gross × (S/T)` |
| `/creator/settlement/{period}` | Read-only statement; **Confirmed** vs **Estimated** badges |

**UX:** Formula block always visible when editing (trust). Export CSV matching template. Dispute window note in footer (14 days per spec).

**Acceptance:** Monthly row matches README settlement formulas; creator sees same numbers.

---

### Slice 3 — TikTok CLI import (BUILD LIST)

**Doc:** checklist § 1 · `tools/tiktok-metadata/README.md`

| Route | Screen |
|-------|--------|
| `/operator/creators/{id}/import` | Paste TikTok profile URL or upload CLI JSON; preview candidate URLs since `last_run_date` |
| Action | Bulk “Add as draft” → publish log rows (status `pending_approval` or draft state) |

**UX:** Step 1 highlighted on batch rail; diff view “new since last run”; music policy warning per row.

**Acceptance:** Operator imports ≥1 URL without manual copy from TikTok app.

---

### Slice 4 — Membership / billing (operator SaaS)

**Doc:** Not in creator commission pilot — pattern from `examples/billing-saas` (Cashier)

| Route | Screen |
|-------|--------|
| `/operator/billing` | Operator org plan (how many creators, tiers) |
| `/settings/subscription` | Stripe portal link |

**UX:** Separate from creator commission invoice — this is **software** billing for the operator using the portal, not the 15–20% creator settlement.

**Acceptance:** Gated creator count or export; Stripe test mode checkout.

---

### Slice 5 — Automation vault (n8n)

**Doc:** Internal tooling boundary in spec — webhooks only, not full n8n UI

| Route | Screen |
|-------|--------|
| `/operator/integrations` | Webhook URLs + event toggles: `publish_log.approved`, `publish_log.published` |
| Docs link | Governance: no auto-publish without approval on Lite tier |

**UX:** Copy webhook URL; test ping; no embedded workflow editor.

**Acceptance:** External n8n flow receives JSON payload on approve event.

---

## Components

| Component | Use |
|-----------|-----|
| `x-batch-loop-rail` | 7-step horizontal stepper; `:current="4"` |
| `x-publish-status` | Status pill — colors match state machine |
| `x-ops-panel` | White card with optional title bar |
| Dev login banner | `auth/login` only |

---

## Inspiration (patterns only)

| Source | Borrow |
|--------|--------|
| [Page Flows](https://pageflows.com/) | Approval inbox layout (card list + primary/secondary actions) — **not** the product |
| [Flowbite admin](https://flowbite.com/blocks/application/) | KPI grid, dense tables, filter chips |
| Google Sheets publish log | Column order and status vocabulary |

**Do not:** marketplace catalog patterns, cart/checkout, vendor storefront chrome.

---

## Verification

- Operator can trace any screen to a checklist step (batch rail + headers).
- Creator sees only approval + (future) settlement read-only.
- Status labels match CSV exactly (`pending_approval`, not “Pending Review”).
- New slice work extends this doc with route + field table before implementation.
- Roadmap execution: [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md) + zero-miss **Mode D** ([`docs/ZERO-MISS-97-TASK-ROADMAP-PROMPT.md`](../../../docs/ZERO-MISS-97-TASK-ROADMAP-PROMPT.md#mode-d--docs--ux--parallel-post-mvp-slices)) — matrix must cover every gap row and CSV column; **parallel waves** inside each wave.
