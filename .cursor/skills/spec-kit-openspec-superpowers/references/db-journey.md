# Direct Book journey (`db-journey`)

**Short names (any of these starts the long task):**

| Say | Same meaning |
|-----|----------------|
| **`/7pj`** | Canonical slash — expand via skill `7pj-wave` (no wave boilerplate) |
| `7pj` | Same without slash |
| `/db-journey` | Alias of `/7pj` |
| `db-journey` / `pl-journey` | Same |
| `7-product-journey` / `7-product-user-journey` | Legacy nickname → same list |
| `8pj` | **Do not use** — soft redirect to `7pj`. `0206` is Marine twin of `0189`, not an 8th line |

Type the **work** only. Agent expands quote (list+pdf+view+create+edit) then policy wire. Default = **all 7 lines**. Extra waves only if `w2`/`w3` or another `do:`. See `.cursor/skills/7pj-wave/SKILL.md`.

## Scope

**In scope (7 lines):** Marine `0189`+twin `0206` · `0191` Burglary · `0192` Money · `0193` Plate · `0194` CAR · `0195` Bond · `0196` PI  

**Verdict (2026-08-13):** Keep **`7pj`**. `0206` (`MARINE_CARGO_2`) = second SM code under same Marine journey as `0189` (`marineCodes()` / `isMarine()` / same `MARINE_CARGO` permission + print). **Not** an 8th product line → **no `8pj` rename**.

**Out:** legacy `0121`–`0125` only  

**Note (2026-08-11):** Bond `0195` **restored** to Direct Book. Prior “6 product / Bond out” docs superseded.

## Default journey matrix

For **each** product, cover:

| Phase | Surfaces |
|-------|----------|
| **Quote** | Form/edit · Detail **view** · Print **PDF** |
| **Policy** | Issue/edit · Detail **view** · Print **PDF** |
| **Endt** | L3 in scope for all 7 (or only if user said `+endt` / `endt-only` when narrowing) |

Path map every cell: shared shell? BUR slice? PDF partial?

## View ↔ PDF style parity (locked experience)

**`view-only` and `pdf-only` use the same content-style checklist** for schedule fields. Compare label wording, uppercase, order, and value presentation — not admin chrome.

### In parity (from top of schedule through end)

Typical Direct Book Detail / print block — treat as one band:

- THE INSURED NAME  
- CORRESPONDENCE ADDRESS  
- BUSINESS / OCCUPATION  
- … (period, wording, extensions, voyage / interest / location, premium, deductible, clauses, warranty, …)  
- INTEREST INSURED (table + Total / extras under Total)  
- … continue through remaining schedule rows …  
- **ISSUED BY** (end of band)

Agent must check **view and PDF** against each other for these fields (and siblings in the same schedule) unless the user narrowed to one surface.

### Out of parity (do not force PDF ≈ view)

| Skip | Why |
|------|-----|
| Colon gutter `:` in admin flex rows | View chrome; PDF uses `Label:` in label cell / 2-col print |
| Buttons, tabs, AuthorizeBlock, download links | Admin only |
| Loading / toast / PrimeVue chrome | Admin only |
| Form edit controls | Not schedule view/PDF |
| Sample black print borders vs admin grey table | Print contract ≠ admin polish (`impeccable` skip) |

### Alignment discipline (when touching amounts)

Follow locked **S2**: Sum Insured body + Total (+ rows under Total) **left**; label against amount column. Same on view + PDF where that Total exists.

## How agent runs it

1. Load `spec-kit-openspec-superpowers` (priority).
2. Build checklist matrix; tick as you go.
3. Prefer **reuse existing records** (`13-smoke-few-records`).
4. Layout / footer / colon issues → brainstorm + visual demo before code.
5. Fat shared → BUR slice (`srp-thin`, `12-claude-task-bur-slice`).
6. Evidence: `docs/evidence/db-journey/<code>-<phase>/`.
7. **`crop png`** (optional flag): save **tight crops** of schedule bands (view screenshot + PDF page/region) as PNG under that folder — not full-desktop noise. Pair view crop + PDF crop per product when both surfaces run.
8. No commit unless asked.

## Narrowing flags

| Flag | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `marine` / `0189` / `0206` / product name | One product line (Marine covers both SM codes) |
| `quote-only` / `policy-only` | One phase |
| `+endt` / `endt-only` | Include / only endorsement |
| `audit` | Path map + gaps only, no code |
| **`view-only`** | Detail **view** — style parity checklist; skip PDF |
| **`pdf-only`** | **PDF** — same checklist as view-only; skip admin chrome |
| **`view-only` + `pdf-only`** | Full view↔PDF parity pass |
| **`crop png`** / `crops` | Capture PNG crops for evidence (schedule band INTEREST…ISSUED BY); store under `docs/evidence/db-journey/` |
